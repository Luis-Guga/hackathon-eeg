# EEG Models

This folder is intended to contain all the model architectures you are going to design to detect and classify key-strokes.

The `riemann_classifier` acts as an example of a simple yet effective model by projecting the EEG data into the covariance manifold.
For this purpose, the details don't matter too much and this model is probably not the best fit for your task but you can use it as a first model to classify the EEG data.
